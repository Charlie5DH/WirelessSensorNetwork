The image above presents us a monthly average of the data received by the radios. We can see which radios communicate with each other and establish a scheme of communication.

- **Module 00.57.FE.0F (Radio R6 In Poço de Drenagem A):**

  Receives constant data from Module 00.57.FE.06. Data from this module has a high Power since they are in the same location. The data started with power around -50 dbm and increased to -40 dbm in 2018/07, then went down to -50 dbm again.

  Receives constant data from module 00.57.FE.05 (Radio R3 in MB) since 2017/12.

  Received data from 00.57.FE.01 (Radio R4 in UG3) until 2019/ 04. Less power due to distance (-90 dbm)

  Missing data from Module 00.57.FE.09 in **201812, 201901, 201902, 201904 and 201905**.

  Receives data until 2019/10 from modules 05, 06 and 03.

- **Module 00.57.FE.06 in Poço de Drenagem:**

   Receives constant data from Module 00.57.FE.0F. Data from this module has a high Power since they are in the same location. The data started with power around -50 dbm and increased to -40 dbm in 2018/07, then went down to -50 dbm again. **(Same behavior than in 0F ).** There is symmetry between what is transmitted and what is received.

  Missing data from Module 00.57.FE.09 in **201812, 201901, 201902, 201904 and 201905**.

  Receives constant data from module 00.57.FE.05 (Radio R3 in MB) since 2017/12.

  Started to receive data from Module 00.57.FE.03 (Transformer) in 2018/ 11. with same behavior and almost same power than in 0F.

  Received data from 00.57.FE.01 (Radio R4 in UG3) until 2019/ 08. Less power due to distance.

  Received data from 00.57.FE.04  Coordinator in some moments, but very unstable communication.

- **Module 00.57.FE.09 in Montante UG3:**

  Receives constant data from all modules. The Module did not transmitted data to some modules some months but was receiving data from them, therefor was online.

  **The module did not received any data in 2019/05. we can assume it was offline.**

  Receives constant data from module 00.57.FE.05 (Radio R3 in MB) since 2017/12 with high power.

  Receives data from Module 00.57.FE.06 with almost the same behavior than the reciprocal (high degree of symmetry). In this case no missing transmission from 06.

  Received data from 00.57.FE.01 (Radio R4 in UG3) until 2019/ 06.

  Receives data from module 04 (Coordinator). <u>Receives data from this module with less power than the used for transmission (transmit to 04 with mean power higher than -70 dbm and receives with less than -70 dbm)</u>.

  Data from all modules is above -80 dbm, probably because this module is located in an open space.

  Receives data from Module 00.57.FE.0F with almost the same behavior than the reciprocal (high degree of symmetry). In this case no missing transmission from 0F although there was a small spike in 2019/03.

  Receives data also from module 0E in UG5 and from module 03.

- **Module 00.57.FE.01 in Montante UG3:**

  Receives constant data from module 00.57.FE.05 (Radio R3 in MB) since 2017/12 with high power.

  Receives data from module 09 in UG3 with similar behavior. <u>Receives data from this module with less power than the module receives (09 receives with higher power than -60 dbm and 01 receives from 09 with less than -60 dbm)</u>.

  Receives data also from module 0E in UG5.

  **Receives data from module 03 with a spike in 2018/08.**

  **Receives data from module 04 Coordinator with very low symmetry, around 8 dbm of difference. Same with module 0E. Receives with less power than the received by the transmitting radio** 

  Receives from 06 and 0F.

- **Module 00.57.FE.03 in Transformer:**

  This module received data from module 05 in a constant way (around -75 dbm) until 2018/11, where started to receive at a higher power (-65 dbm), an increase of around 10 dbm.

  Received data from module 01 presenting a spike in 2018/11 also.

  Received data from module 09 until **2018/11 and the missing data until 2019/06**. Same behavior than in module 09. Module 09 received from 03 until 2018/11 and then missing data until 2019/06.

  **Starts receiving data from modules 06, 04, and 0F in 2018/11. And transmitting to them around this date to with good symmetry.**

  Receives few data from module 0E in 2018/11 (as the opposite case) and then again in 2019/08.

- **Module 00.57.FE.05 in Main Building:**

  This module is the most consistent one. Receives data from all the other modules all the time and transmit to all.

  Difference with 03 (Transformer) is around 5 dbm.

  Good symmetry with module 01.

  Receives data from module 09 until 2018/11 and then in 2019/03.

  Lower power data comes from radio 0E located in UG5 with the highest distance.

  The radio started functioning in 2017/12, two months after the rest.

  Serves as bridge to all modules.
